# E Mini Project 1: Microplastics Exhibit
This repository is a demonstration of a possible projected floor of my immersive exhibit about microplastics. If you're interested, I explain the concept [in my medium blog](https://brycedli.medium.com/designing-a-hybrid-exhibit-4c3d0d0c494f). 

This was my first time using p5.js. 

## Running
You can find an online demo at the link [here](https://brycedli.github.io/microplastic_p5/). If you're running it locally, just open ```microplastic_p5/index.js ``` in your browser.
